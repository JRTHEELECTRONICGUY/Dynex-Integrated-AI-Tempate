## Ethics Core  

The **Ethics Core** ensures that all AI tasks adhere to responsible and ethical standards. It is designed to safeguard user privacy, promote transparency, and prevent misuse of AI capabilities.  

### Core Principles:  
1. **Transparency:** Users are informed of how their data is processed.  
2. **Privacy:** All data is encrypted, and sensitive information is never stored without consent.  
3. **Fairness:** AI models are evaluated to prevent biases in outputs.  
4. **Sustainability:** Tasks are optimized to reduce unnecessary compute cycles, minimizing environmental impact.  

### How It Works:  
- Each submitted task is analyzed against predefined ethical guidelines.  
- Tasks flagged for potential violations (e.g., biased models or unauthorized data usage) are paused, and users are notified with actionable steps.  
- A detailed compliance report is available for all tasks.

## **Getting Started**  

Follow these steps to install, configure, and use the Dynex AI Integration Platform.  

### **Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.x installed  
- `pip` (Python package installer) installed  
- Dynex Coin (DNX) wallet with funds for task execution  
- Access to the Dynex marketplace (optional for premium services)

---

## **Installation**  

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>

3.	Install dependencies:
Use the following command to install all required libraries and packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3.	Configure your API keys and environment settings:
Create a .env file in the project root to store your environment variables:

DYNEX_API_KEY=your_dynex_api_key
DNX_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address

---

# .env File Configuration (.env Setup)

To run the application properly, you need to configure a .env file with essential environment variables. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you set up the file.

Step 1: Create the .env File

 1. In the root directory of your project, create a new file named .env.
 2. Open the file and add the following key-value pairs based on your specific configuration.

# Application Config
APP_NAME=YourAppNameHere
APP_ENV=development # Change to 'production' for deployment
APP_PORT=5000 # Port the app runs on

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432 # Default port for PostgreSQL
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASS=your_database_password

# Dynex Payment Configuration
DNX_API_KEY=your_dynex_api_key
DNX_SECRET_KEY=your_dynex_secret_key
DNX_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_dynex_wallet_address

# Security and Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key # For token-based authentication
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_here

# Logging and Debugging
LOG_LEVEL=debug # Change to 'info' or 'error' in production

# Optional Email Setup (if applicable)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password

Step 2: Customize the Variables

 • Replace your_database_name, your_database_user, and your_database_password with your actual database credentials.
 • Add your Dynex API Key, Secret Key, and Wallet Address to ensure the payment system works properly.
 • Use a strong JWT_SECRET and ENCRYPTION_KEY to secure your application.
 • Configure any email settings if your app requires sending emails.

Step 3: Use the .env File in Your Code

Make sure your code reads these variables properly using a library like dotenv in Python or Node.js. Example:

Python Example (with dotenv):

from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

db_host = os.getenv('DB_HOST')
jwt_secret = os.getenv('JWT_SECRET')

Node.js Example (with dotenv):

require('dotenv').config();

const dbHost = process.env.DB_HOST;
const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;

Step 4: Ensure Security

 • Do not commit your .env file to version control (GitHub) by adding it to .gitignore.
 • Only share environment variables with trusted team members or use deployment services with environment variable management.

Troubleshooting Tips

 1. If the app doesn’t start, ensure all required variables are correctly set in the .env file.
 2. Double-check that the .env file is in the root directory of your project.
 3. If you’re deploying to production, ensure the environment is set to APP_ENV=production for optimal performance
